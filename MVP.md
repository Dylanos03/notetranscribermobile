# Voice-to-Notion MVP Requirements

## Product Overview
A simple web app that records voice notes, transcribes them, polishes the text with AI, and automatically creates a formatted note in Notion.

## Target User
Knowledge workers, students, and professionals who want to quickly capture thoughts and have them automatically organized in their Notion workspace.

## Core Value Proposition
Turn messy voice notes into polished Notion pages in seconds - no typing, no manual cleanup.

---

## MVP Features (Phase 1)

### 1. Voice Recording
- **Single-page web app** with a large "Record" button
- Click to start recording, click again to stop
- Maximum recording length: 5 minutes
- Visual indicator while recording (waveform or pulsing button)
- Browser-based recording (no mobile app needed initially)

### 2. Transcription
- Use **OpenAI Whisper API** for accurate transcription
- Support English language only for MVP
- Show "Transcribing..." loading state

### 3. AI Polishing
- Send transcription to **GPT-4o-mini** (cost-effective)
- Prompt to:
  - Remove filler words (um, uh, like, etc.)
  - Fix grammar and punctuation
  - Organize into clear paragraphs
  - Generate a concise title based on content
- Show "Polishing..." loading state

### 4. Notion Integration
- User provides their **Notion Integration token** (manual setup)
- User provides a **Notion Database ID** where notes should be created
- Create a new page in the specified database with:
  - Title (generated by AI)
  - Body content (polished text)
  - Timestamp property (when created)
  - Optional: "Source: Voice Note" tag

### 5. Simple Setup Flow
- Landing page explains the product
- "Get Started" button leads to setup:
  1. Instructions to create a Notion integration
  2. Input field for Notion API key
  3. Input field for Notion Database ID
  4. "Save & Start Recording" button
- Store credentials in browser localStorage (not production-ready but fine for MVP)

## What's NOT in the MVP

❌ **No MCP integration** - Keep it simple, always save to one database
❌ **No intelligent note placement** - User manually selects database
❌ **No user accounts/authentication** - Rely on Notion API key
❌ **No editing before saving** - Just transcribe → polish → save
❌ **No voice note history** - Each recording is independent
❌ **No payment/monetization** - Free to validate demand
❌ **No multiple language support** - English only
❌ **No note categorization** - Single database destination

---

## Technical Stack

### Frontend (Mobile app)
- Expo
- React native
- Axios for apis

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express** (simple REST API)
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/transcribe` - Upload audio, get transcription
  - `POST /api/create-note` - Send polished text to Notion

### APIs/Services
- **OpenAI Whisper API** - Transcription ($0.006/minute)
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Text polishing (~$0.0001 per note)
- **Notion API** - Create pages (free)

### Hosting (Suggestions)
- **Frontend:** Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions, Railway, or Render
- Total estimated cost: $5-20/month for 1000 notes

## Success Metrics (Validation)

Track these to validate product-market fit:

1. **Activation Rate:** % of visitors who complete setup
2. **Usage Frequency:** Average notes created per user per week
3. **Retention:** % of users who return after first use
4. **Qualitative Feedback:** Collect user testimonials
5. **Time Saved:** Compare time to create voice note vs. manual typing

**MVP Goal:** 100 users creating 10+ notes each within first month

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Day 1-2:** Frontend (recording UI + setup flow)
- **Day 3-4:** Backend (transcription + LLM polishing)
- **Day 5:** Notion integration
- **Day 6:** Testing and bug fixes
- **Day 7:** Deploy and ship!

**Total: ~1 week for solo developer**

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **API costs too high** | Set per-user rate limits, monitor usage |
| **Transcription accuracy issues** | Add manual edit option in Phase 2 |
| **Notion API complexity** | Start with single database, expand later |
| **User setup too complicated** | Create detailed video tutorial |
| **Low adoption** | Share on Product Hunt, Reddit, Indie Hackers |

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

1. **Launch Platforms:**
   - Product Hunt (aim for top 5)
   - Hacker News Show HN
   - Reddit: r/Notion, r/productivity, r/SideProject

2. **Content Marketing:**
   - Blog post: "I built a voice-to-Notion app in 7 days"
   - Twitter thread showing demo
   - YouTube tutorial on setup

3. **Early Adopters:**
   - Notion communities on Discord/Slack
   - Productivity influencers (offer free lifetime access)

---

## Decision Framework

**Ship the MVP when:**
- ✅ Core flow works end-to-end (record → transcribe → polish → save)
- ✅ Setup instructions are clear
- ✅ Error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ Tested with 5-10 real notes

**Don't wait for:**
- ❌ Perfect UI/UX
- ❌ Every edge case handled
- ❌ Advanced features
- ❌ Mobile optimization

---

## Open Questions for Validation

Ask early users:
1. Would you pay for this? How much?
2. What's missing that would make this a daily tool?
3. Where else would you want notes to go (besides Notion)?
4. Do you prefer editing before saving, or trust the AI?

---

## Budget Estimate

**Development:** $0 (your time)
**Hosting:** $10-20/month
**APIs (100 users × 10 notes):**
- Whisper: ~$6 (1000 × 2min avg × $0.006)
- GPT-4o-mini: ~$0.10
**Domain:** $12/year

**Total first month: ~$50**

## Next Steps

1. Clone/create repository
2. Set up basic Express server
3. Build recording interface
4. Integrate OpenAI APIs
5. Connect Notion API
6. Deploy and test
7. Share with 10 friends for feedback
8. Launch publicly!

**Remember:** The goal is to validate demand, not build the perfect product. Ship fast, learn, iterate.
